 **_Power BI Desktop_** – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
 **_Power Query_** – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
 **_DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)_** – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
 **_Data Modeling_** – Relationships established among dimensional tables and he central table to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.

## Walkthrough of Key Visuals 🗂️🖥️

⦁	 **_Year Slicer Panel_**  📆 (Buttons) An interactive slicer made of buttons lets users filter all visuals by a specific year, ranging from 2010 to 2027, or potentially see a trend across a range.

⦁	**_Age-Category Slicer Panel_ (Buttons)** An interactive slicer made of buttons allows users to filter the data displayed by selecting a specific demographic age group, such as Adult, Child, Teenager, Baby, Senior, or Young adult.

⦁	**_Sum of Population, Female-Population Share by Year and Region (Line Chart)_** 📈  This line chart shows population trends over time (from 2010 to 2040), segmented by major regions like Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. Selecting a region in the legend will highlight or isolate that region's line across the time series.

⦁	**_Sum of Population by Region (Bar Chart)_** 📊This bar chart visually compares the total population across the major world regions. Clicking on a specific region (like Asia or Africa) on the bar chart will act as a filter, applying that regional selection to all other visuals on the dashboard.

⦁	**_Sum of Population by Country (Treemap)_** The treemap displays the population distribution across many countries, with the size of each colored square corresponding to the country's population. Clicking on a large country (e.g., China, India, United States of America) will filter the dashboard to show the data for that selected nation.

 ## Business Impact & Insights📉📃

**_Demographic Planning_**: Governments and social services can use the age-category filters and yearly data to predict future needs for schools, healthcare, and pensions.

**_Market Analysis_**: Businesses can use the country and region filters to identify the largest and fastest-growing markets for their products and services.

**_Time Series Analysis_**: Analysts can use the year slicer and line chart to understand historical population changes and project future demographic shifts across continents.
