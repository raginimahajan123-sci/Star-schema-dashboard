## The Population Star schema dashboard 
 A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to explore population data worldwide focusing on regional comparisons, its attributes,
 demographics.

## Short Description / Purpose
The Star Schema Dashboard is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI report designed to help users explore and compare populations across different countries, ages and genders. The dashboard focuses on highlighting the ratio of male vs female and age demographic wise trends and characteristics population density globally.

## Tech Stack
 The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
 **_Power BI Desktop_** – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
 **_Power Query_** – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
 **_DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)_** – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
 **_Data Modeling_** – Relationships established among dimensional tables and he central table to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
 
## File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

## Walkthrough of Key Visuals

⦁	 **_Year Slicer Panel_** (Buttons) An interactive slicer made of buttons lets users filter all visuals by a specific year, ranging from 2010 to 2027, or potentially see a trend across a range.

⦁	**_Age-Category Slicer Panel_ (Buttons)** An interactive slicer made of buttons allows users to filter the data displayed by selecting a specific demographic age group, such as Adult, Child, Teenager, Baby, Senior, or Young adult.

⦁	**_Sum of Population, Female-Population Share by Year and Region (Line Chart)_** This line chart shows population trends over time (from 2010 to 2040), segmented by major regions like Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, and South America. Selecting a region in the legend will highlight or isolate that region's line across the time series.

⦁	**_Sum of Population by Region (Bar Chart)_** This bar chart visually compares the total population across the major world regions. Clicking on a specific region (like Asia or Africa) on the bar chart will act as a filter, applying that regional selection to all other visuals on the dashboard.

⦁	**_Sum of Population by Country (Treemap)_** The treemap displays the population distribution across many countries, with the size of each colored square corresponding to the country's population. Clicking on a large country (e.g., China, India, United States of America) will filter the dashboard to show the data for that selected nation.

 ## Business Impact & Insights

**_Demographic Planning_**: Governments and social services can use the age-category filters and yearly data to predict future needs for schools, healthcare, and pensions.

**_Market Analysis_**: Businesses can use the country and region filters to identify the largest and fastest-growing markets for their products and services.

**_Time Series Analysis_**: Analysts can use the year slicer and line chart to understand historical population changes and project future demographic shifts across continents.
